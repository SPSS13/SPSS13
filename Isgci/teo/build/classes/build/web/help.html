<a name="main"></a><h2>Main window</h2>
   Inclusion diagrams are drawn here. Superclasses are drawn above their
   subclasses, with a directed arrow going from superclass to subclass. If
   ISGCI has no information indicating that an inclusion is proper, a grey
   arrowhead is drawn at the superclass end of the arrow. For the meaning of
   the colours, see <a href="#problemdefs">Problem definitions</a>.<br>
   =&gt; Dragging a graph class will move it.<br>
   =&gt; Right-click on a graph class or on an edge will display a menu for
   the class or inclusion.<br><br>

<a name="file"></a><h2>File menu</h2>
   <dl>
      <dt>New window</dt>
	 <dd>Open a new, independent ISGCI window.</dd>
      <dt>Export drawing...</dt>
	 <dd>Export the current drawing as an Structured Vector Graphics (SVG) or 
     Image file (PNG,JPG).<br/>
	 An SVG file can be manipulated by many drawing programs, allowing you 
     to e.g. add classes.<br/>
	 A Image file contains either the whole graph as an image or an extract from the graph  
     (i.e. the part of the graph, which can be seen in the viewport (canvas))<br/>

<a name="view"></a><h2>View menu</h2>
   <dl>
      <dt>Fit in window</dt>
	  <dd>Zooms the current drawn graph with a scale factor, to fit the whole shown graph into the current window size (as far as possible; there is a boundary, how small the scalefactor is allowed to be: ~0.05). There are used a policy to zoom a graph (in), iff it's width and height are smaller than 75% of the current window size.</dd>

   <dl>
      <dt>Search...</dt>
	 <dd>Centers the drawing on a graph class that can be selected from a
	 list of all displayed classes.</dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
      <dt>Naming preference</dt>
	 <dd>Select the prefered name for classes in inclusion diagrams. A
	 class can be defined in different ways and accordingly have
	 different names. This menu item will popup a dialogue box that
	 allows you to select the prefered name for classes that have more
	 than one name. The options are:
	 <ul>
	    <li><em>Basic</em>. Any name that does not qualify as one of the
	    other preferences.</li>
	    <li><em>Forbidden subgraphs</em>. Characterization by forbidden
	    subgraphs.</li>
	    <li><em>Derived</em>. Characterization by set operations
	    (intersect, union, complement) on (an)other graph class(es).</li>

        When checked, the <a href="#sidebar">Sidebar</a> on the left hand side from the Main window is openend, where further information are shown about the current (last) selected graphclass. 
    </dd>
   </dl>

<a name="edit"></a><h2>Edit menu</h2>
   <dl>
      <dt>Animation</dt>
	 <dd>When checked, then animations are activated, i.e. if you add neighbours, superclasses or subclasses for a selected node in the graph, then according to these changes the graph will be animated into his new appearance. Yet, this part of the software is still experimental, which means, that there could appear some Bugs, but this relates to the used graph drawing library. Therefore only further improvements of the library can fix these problems in the future.</dd>
      <dt>Undo</dt>
	 <dd>Undos the last change(s) in the drawn graph (e.g. draw..., move a node, add superclasses/subclasses)</dd>
      <dt>Redo</dt>
	 <dd>According to Undo: Redos last "Undo(s)". You can't redo before you did an "Undo". </dd>
      <dt>Relayout</dt>
	 <dd>Computes a new layout for the current nodes and edges, which the canvas currently consists and draws it. (Animation, iff activated)</dd>

<a name="selection"></a><h2>Selection menu</h2>
   <dl> Consists mostly of the same features like the context menu of the graph classes; i.e. the Popup menu of graphclasses or inclusions. Those funtionalities which will not have any effect on the graph are grayed out.
      <dt>Show information</dt>
	 <dd>Opens the graph class information dialogue and the selected class in the list is the selected graphclass in the graph or opens the Relation dialogue if an inclusion is selected.</dd>

	 <dd>Hides all current shown superclasses of the selected graphclass in the drawing pane.</dd>
     <dt>Super - show</dt>
	 <dd>Shows all superclasses, iff they are added to the current universum of the drawing; i.e. you can only show superclasses, if you added it before or they existed since using a dialogue.</dd>
     <dt>Super - add</dt>
	 <dd>Adds all adjacent (direct inclusion) superclasses of the selected graphclass. </dd>

<a name="classes"></a><h2>Graph classes menu</h2>
   <dl>
      <dt>Browse database</dt>
	 <dd>Browse the database by class name. The top half of the dialogue
	 box display a list of classes.  The <a href="#filter">Filter
	 box</a> can be used to limit the display of classes.  Classes are
	 sorted alphabetically, where capitals come before lower case, and
	 special characters are ignored for the sorting order. Clicking on a
	 class will select it and display information in the lower half of
	 the window.<br> The information displayed is the complexity on the
	 current graph class for one problem, and, below that, super-, sub-
	 and equivalent classes.<br>
	 =&gt; Single clicking a class in one of the three lower lists
	 selects it and double clicking will display information on it in
	 the current window.<br>
	 =&gt; Clicking <em>Class info</em> will display information on the
	 current graphclass, including the complexity of all problems.<br>
	 =&gt; Clicking <em>Inclusion info</em> will display the inclusion
	 between the current graph class and the selected one from one of
	 the super/sub/equivalent lists.</dd>
      <dt>Find relation</dt>
	 <dd>Select a graph class in the top list, and one in the bottom
	 list and press <em>Find relation</em> to find the relation between
	 them.  The <a href="#filter">Filter boxes</a> can be used to limit
	 the display of classes in both lists.  If one of the classes is a
	 subclass of the other an inclusion path will be displayed.
	 Otherwise the minimal common superclasses and maximal common
	 subclasses are displayed.<br> =&gt; Clicking on an inclusion button
	 in the result window will display references to this
	 inclusion.</dd>
      <dt>Draw...</dt>
	 <dd>Select one or more graph classes, whether you would like
	 their super/subclasses to be drawn also, and click <em>New
	 drawing</em> to create a new inclusion diagram in the current
	 window.  The <a href="#filter">Filter box</a> can be used to limit
	 the display of classes.

      <dt>Boundary/open classes</dt>
	 <dd>Selecting a problem from the submenu to this item will display
	 a dialogue box with three lists of graph classes:<br>
	 <em>Minimal NP-complete</em> classes have a direct subclass for
	 which the problem is not NP-complete,<br>
	 <em>open</em> classes for which the complexity is unknown and<br>
	 <em>maximal P</em> classes have a direct superclass for which the

<a name="sidebar"></a><h2>Sidebar including information about selected graphclass</h2>
To display more information about a selected graph class (in the drawn graph within the Main window). These information will be loaded from the http://www.graphclasses.org/ Website on the fly, wherefore a continuous internet connection is required for correct functionality. There are different ways to open a Sidebar on the left hand side of the window (context menu of classes: Popup, Selection menu, View menu). The sidebar can also be open by pressing the button on the left hand side on the window, if closed and closed via the same button between the sidebar and the Main window, which also serves as semantic border among them. If opened, then there are three content boxes, in which all of the on the top is written the current name of the graph class:<p>
Graphclass: Contains information about equivalent, complement and related classes, if they exist. Moreover it holds the formal definition of the class. </br>
Inclusion: Includes an overall description about inclusions and especially for every class its minimal superclasses and maximal subclasses (if they exist). </br>
Problems: Contains the list of all problems, like in the Problems Dropdown-Menu. They get acutalized if another class will be selected (like the other content boxes - actualized) and the problems are displayed according to the color like on the website. A very useful feature is, that you can press on a problem to set the correlated color for all classes in the canvas.<p>

<a name="problemdefs"></a><h2>Problem definitions</h2>
   Normal rules for colouring are as follows:
   <ul>
      <li><b><font color=red>Red</font></b> for NP-complete classes.</li>
      <li><b><font color='#CC8080'>Light red</font></b> for GI-complete
      (GraphIsomorphism-complete) classes.</li>
      <li>White for open classes.</li>
      <li><b><font color=darkgreen>Dark green</font></b> for classes in
      P.</li>
      <li><b><font color=lightgreen>Light green</font></b> for classes on
      which the problem can be solved in linear time.</li>
   </ul>
   Some pseudo-problems (cliquewidth, cliquewidth expression) have their own
   rules; see the descriptions below.
   <dl>
      <dt>Recognition</dt>
	 <dd>The recognition problem for a graphclass <i>X</i> has as input a
	 graph <i>G</i> and asks whether <i>G</i> is in <i>X</i>.
	 </dd>
      <dt>Independent set</dt>
	 <dd>An independent set of a graph is a pairwise independent
	 subset of its vertices. The independent set problem has
	 as input a graph <i>G</i> and a natural number <i>k</i> and asks
	 whether <i>G</i> has an independent set of at least <i>k</i>
	 vertices.</dd>
      <dt>Weighted independent set</dt>
	 <dd>The weighted independent set problem has as input a vertex
	 weighted graph <i>G</i> and a real number <i>k</i> and asks whether
	 <i>G</i> has an independent set with total weight at least
	 <i>k</i>.</dd>
      <dt>Domination</dt>
	 <dd>A dominating set of a graph G is a subset of its vertices such
	 that every vertex of the graph is either in the set itself or has a
	 neighbour in the set. The domination (or dominating set) problem
	 has as input a graph <i>G</i> and a natural number <i>k</i> and
	 asks whether <i>G</i> has a dominating set of size at most
	 <i>k</i>.</dd>
      <dt>Clique</dt>
	 <dd>A clique of a graph is a pairwise adjacent subset of its vertices.
	 The maximum clique problem has as input a graph <i>G</i> and a natural
	 number <i>k</i> and asks whether <i>G</i> has a clique of at least
	 <i>k</i> vertices.</dd>
      <dt>Weighted clique</dt>
	 <dd>The weighted clique problem has as input a vertex weighted graph
	 <i>G</i> and a real number <i>k</i> and asks whether <i>G</i> has a
	 clique with total weight at least <i>k</i>.</dd>
      <dt>Cliquewidth</dt>
	 <dd>The cliquewidth of a graph is the number of different labels
	 that is needed to construct the graph using the following
	 operations:
	 <ul>
	    <li>creation of a vertex with label <i>i</i>,</li>
	    <li>disjoint union,</li>
	    <li>renaming labels <i>i</i> to label <i>j</i>,</li>
	    <li>connecting all vertices with label <i>i</i> to all
	    vertices with label <i>j</i>.
	 </ul>
	 The colouring happens in the following way:
	 <ul>
	    <li><b><font color=red>Red</font></b> for classes whose
	    cliquewidth is not constant bounded.</li>
	    <li>White for open classes.</li>
	    <li><b><font color=lightgreen>Light green</font></b> for classes
	    with constant bounded cliquewidth.</li>
	 </ul>
	 </dd>
      <dt>Cliquewidth expression</dt>
	 <dd>The cliquewidth expression problem has as input a graph
	 <i>G</i> and as output an expression constructing that graph that
	 uses only a constant number of labels.
	 The colouring happens in the following way:
	    <ul>
	       <li><b><font color=red>Red</font></b> for classes whose
	       cliquewidth is not constant bounded, or for which finding a
	       clique expression is NP-complete.</li>
	       <li>White for open classes.</li>
	       <li><b><font color=darkgreen>Dark green</font></b> for
	       classes that have constant bounded cliquewidth, and a clique
	       expression can be found in polynomial time.</li>
	       <li><b><font color=lightgreen>Light green</font></b> for
	       classes with constant bounded cliquewidth and for which a
	       clique expression can be found in linear time.</li>
	    </ul>
	 </dd>

<a name="filter"></a><h2>Filtering lists of graph classes</h2>
   To limit the display of classes, enter one or more keywords in the filter
   box and press ENTER. Only classes that contain all given keywords
   anywhere in their name or definition will be displayed. To list all
   available classes, clear the filter box and press ENTER.<p>
   Filtering is case insensitive and the filtering process has some limited
   knowledge about graph names. E.g. if you filter on 'chair', 'fork' will
   also be found.<p>
