<a name="main"></a><h2>Main window</h2>
   Inclusion diagrams are drawn here. Superclasses are drawn above their
   subclasses, with a directed arrow going from superclass to subclass. If
   ISGCI has no information indicating that an inclusion is proper, a grey
   arrowhead is drawn at the superclass end of the arrow. For the meaning of
   the colours, see <a href="#problemdefs">Problem definitions</a>.<br>
   =&gt; Dragging a graph class will move it.<br>
   =&gt; Right-click on a graph class or on an edge will display a menu for
   the class or inclusion.<br><br>

<a name="file"></a><h2>File menu</h2>
   <dl>
      <dt>New window</dt>
	 <dd>Open a new, independent ISGCI window.</dd>
      <dt>Export drawing...</dt>
	 <dd>Export the current drawing as an Encapsulated Postscript (EPS),
	 Structured Vector Graphics (SVG) or GraphML file.<br/>
	 A Postscript file can be included directly in your papers. Papersize,
	 scaling and colour or black-and-white print can be selected.<br/>
	 An SVG file cannot be included directly in a LaTeX paper, but it can
	 be manipulated by many drawing programs, allowing you to e.g. add
	 classes.<br/>
	 A GraphML file contains a list of classes and the relations between
	 them, but no drawing.<br/>

	 list of all displayed classes.</dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
      <dt>Naming preference</dt>
	 <dd>Select the prefered name for classes in inclusion diagrams. A
	 class can be defined in different ways and accordingly have
	 different names. This menu item will popup a dialogue box that
	 allows you to select the prefered name for classes that have more
	 than one name. The options are:
	 <ul>
	    <li><em>Basic</em>. Any name that does not qualify as one of the
	    other preferences.</li>
	    <li><em>Forbidden subgraphs</em>. Characterization by forbidden
	    subgraphs.</li>
	    <li><em>Derived</em>. Characterization by set operations
	    (intersect, union, complement) on (an)other graph class(es).</li>
	 </ul></dd>

<a name="classes"></a><h2>Graph classes menu</h2>
   <dl>
      <dt>Browse database</dt>
	 <dd>Browse the database by class name. The top half of the dialogue
	 box display a list of classes.  The <a href="#filter">Filter
	 box</a> can be used to limit the display of classes.  Classes are
	 sorted alphabetically, where capitals come before lower case, and
	 special characters are ignored for the sorting order. Clicking on a
	 class will select it and display information in the lower half of
	 the window.<br> The information displayed is the complexity on the
	 current graph class for one problem, and, below that, super-, sub-
	 and equivalent classes.<br>
	 =&gt; Single clicking a class in one of the three lower lists
	 selects it and double clicking will display information on it in
	 the current window.<br>
	 =&gt; Clicking <em>Class info</em> will display information on the
	 current graphclass, including the complexity of all problems.<br>
	 =&gt; Clicking <em>Inclusion info</em> will display the inclusion
	 between the current graph class and the selected one from one of
	 the super/sub/equivalent lists.</dd>
      <dt>Find relation</dt>
	 <dd>Select a graph class in the top list, and one in the bottom
	 list and press <em>Find relation</em> to find the relation between
	 them.  The <a href="#filter">Filter boxes</a> can be used to limit
	 the display of classes in both lists.  If one of the classes is a
	 subclass of the other an inclusion path will be displayed.
	 Otherwise the minimal common superclasses and maximal common
	 subclasses are displayed.<br> =&gt; Clicking on an inclusion button
	 in the result window will display references to this
	 inclusion.</dd>
      <dt>Draw</dt>
	 <dd>Select one or more graph classes, whether you would like
	 their super/subclasses to be drawn also, and click <em>New
	 drawing</em> to create a new inclusion diagram in the current
	 window.  The <a href="#filter">Filter box</a> can be used to limit
	 the display of classes.

<a name="problems"></a><h2>Problems menu</h2>
   <dl>
      <dt>Boundary/open classes</dt>
	 <dd>Selecting a problem from the submenu to this item will display
	 a dialogue box with three lists of graph classes:<br>
	 <em>Minimal NP-complete</em> classes have a direct subclass for
	 which the problem is not NP-complete,<br>
	 <em>open</em> classes for which the complexity is unknown and<br>
	 <em>maximal P</em> classes have a direct superclass for which the
	 problem is not known to be in P.<br>
	 =&gt; Clicking on a class will select it.<br>
	 =&gt; Clicking <em>Draw</em> will display the border between P and
	 NP-complete surrounding the selected graph class.<br>
	 =&gt; Clicking <em>Class info</em> will display information on the
	 selected graph class.</dd>
      <dt>Colour for problem</dt>
	 <dd>Selecting a problem from the submenu to this item will colour
	 inclusion diagrams according to the complexity of the selected
	 problem, see <a href="#problemdefs">problem definitions</a></dd>
   </dl>
   <a href="#contents">Back to contents</a>

<a name="problemdefs"></a><h2>Problem definitions</h2>
   Normal rules for colouring are as follows:
   <ul>
      <li><b><font color=red>Red</font></b> for NP-complete classes.</li>
      <li><b><font color='#CC8080'>Light red</font></b> for GI-complete
      (GraphIsomorphism-complete) classes.</li>
      <li>White for open classes.</li>
      <li><b><font color=darkgreen>Dark green</font></b> for classes in
      P.</li>
      <li><b><font color=lightgreen>Light green</font></b> for classes on
      which the problem can be solved in linear time.</li>
   </ul>
   Some pseudo-problems (cliquewidth, cliquewidth expression) have their own
   rules; see the descriptions below.
   <dl>
      <dt>Recognition</dt>
	 <dd>The recognition problem for a graphclass <i>X</i> has as input a
	 graph <i>G</i> and asks whether <i>G</i> is in <i>X</i>.
	 </dd>
      <dt>Independent set</dt>
	 <dd>An independent set of a graph is a pairwise independent
	 subset of its vertices. The independent set problem has
	 as input a graph <i>G</i> and a natural number <i>k</i> and asks
	 whether <i>G</i> has an independent set of at least <i>k</i>
	 vertices.</dd>
      <dt>Weighted independent set</dt>
	 <dd>The weighted independent set problem has as input a vertex
	 weighted graph <i>G</i> and a real number <i>k</i> and asks whether
	 <i>G</i> has an independent set with total weight at least
	 <i>k</i>.</dd>
      <dt>Domination</dt>
	 <dd>A dominating set of a graph G is a subset of its vertices such
	 that every vertex of the graph is either in the set itself or has a
	 neighbour in the set. The domination (or dominating set) problem
	 has as input a graph <i>G</i> and a natural number <i>k</i> and
	 asks whether <i>G</i> has a dominating set of size at most
	 <i>k</i>.</dd>
      <dt>Clique</dt>
	 <dd>A clique of a graph is a pairwise adjacent subset of its vertices.
	 The maximum clique problem has as input a graph <i>G</i> and a natural
	 number <i>k</i> and asks whether <i>G</i> has a clique of at least
	 <i>k</i> vertices.</dd>
      <dt>Weighted clique</dt>
	 <dd>The weighted clique problem has as input a vertex weighted graph
	 <i>G</i> and a real number <i>k</i> and asks whether <i>G</i> has a
	 clique with total weight at least <i>k</i>.</dd>
      <dt>Cliquewidth</dt>
	 <dd>The cliquewidth of a graph is the number of different labels
	 that is needed to construct the graph using the following
	 operations:
	 <ul>
	    <li>creation of a vertex with label <i>i</i>,</li>
	    <li>disjoint union,</li>
	    <li>renaming labels <i>i</i> to label <i>j</i>,</li>
	    <li>connecting all vertices with label <i>i</i> to all
	    vertices with label <i>j</i>.
	 </ul>
	 The colouring happens in the following way:
	 <ul>
	    <li><b><font color=red>Red</font></b> for classes whose
	    cliquewidth is not constant bounded.</li>
	    <li>White for open classes.</li>
	    <li><b><font color=lightgreen>Light green</font></b> for classes
	    with constant bounded cliquewidth.</li>
	 </ul>
	 </dd>
      <dt>Cliquewidth expression</dt>
	 <dd>The cliquewidth expression problem has as input a graph
	 <i>G</i> and as output an expression constructing that graph that
	 uses only a constant number of labels.
	 The colouring happens in the following way:
	    <ul>
	       <li><b><font color=red>Red</font></b> for classes whose
	       cliquewidth is not constant bounded, or for which finding a
	       clique expression is NP-complete.</li>
	       <li>White for open classes.</li>
	       <li><b><font color=darkgreen>Dark green</font></b> for
	       classes that have constant bounded cliquewidth, and a clique
	       expression can be found in polynomial time.</li>
	       <li><b><font color=lightgreen>Light green</font></b> for
	       classes with constant bounded cliquewidth and for which a
	       clique expression can be found in linear time.</li>
	    </ul>
	 </dd>

<a name="filter"></a><h2>Filtering lists of graph classes</h2>
   To limit the display of classes, enter one or more keywords in the filter
   box and press ENTER. Only classes that contain all given keywords
   anywhere in their name or definition will be displayed. To list all
   available classes, clear the filter box and press ENTER.<p>
   Filtering is case insensitive and the filtering process has some limited
   knowledge about graph names. E.g. if you filter on 'chair', 'fork' will
   also be found.<p>
